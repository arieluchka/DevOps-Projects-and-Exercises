## Mini-Projects

This repo will have Projects and exercises, that are focused on combining various tools you've learned along the way!

Writing a python program that uses a SQL database; Containerizing an application and deploying it into a K8S cluster; Creating several VMs with Terraform, and controlling them with Ansible!

These Mini-Projects will be longer (and maybe harder), but are great to experience how different tools work together!
