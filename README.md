# DevOps Projects and Exercises

This git repository will slowly fill up with labs, exercises and project ideas revolving around DevOps Technologies (Python, Docker, K8S, monitoring, CICD, cloud, etc.)

Right now there are:
- [Python exercises](https://github.com/arieluchka/DevOps-Projects-and-Exercises/tree/main/Topics/02-Python/Exercises)
- [a Docker exercise](https://github.com/arieluchka/DevOps-Projects-and-Exercises/tree/main/Topics/08-Docker/Exercises)
- [git learning material](https://github.com/arieluchka/DevOps-Projects-and-Exercises/tree/main/Topics/01-Git)

**Whats planned?**
- python exercises around external libraries (os/sys/FastAPI/requests/mysql)
- Docker exercises (you are given an application and tasked to containerize it)
- Interconnected Project (build a python application that communicates with a SQL db/build a python application and containerize it/Build a CICD pipeline and auto build, package and push your application)
- More learning material and outside sources to always have somewhere to learn from.
