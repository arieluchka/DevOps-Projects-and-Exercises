## Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome#:~:text=A%20palindrome%20is%20a%20word%2C%20number%2C%20phrase%2C%20or%20other%20sequence%20of%20symbols%20that%20reads%20the%20same%20backwards%20as%20forwards), and false otherwise.

Write your code in the "ispalindrome" function. The function should return True/False (if the input is a palindrome or not)

**Run the file main.py to test your code.**

## Examples:
### Example 1:
**Input**: x = 121

**Output**: true

**Explanation**: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2:
**Input**: x = -121

**Output**: false

**Explanation**: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3:
**Input**: x = 10

**Output**: false

**Explanation**: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
