## Containerize By Demand

This folder will include exercises that already have all the application files of the product.
Your Job is to **conrainerize the application into a working docker image**. 
You will have to research what dependencies the application needs, how to install them and what entry command is needed to run the application successfully.

Some exercises will be easy, some will be harder. 
**The goal is to help you practice researching what different applications need, without even knowing the coding language!**
