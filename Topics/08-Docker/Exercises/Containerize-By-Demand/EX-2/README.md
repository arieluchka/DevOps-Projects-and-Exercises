## Containerize a Weather Dashboard App
This is a simple Weather Dashboard web application that uses Python, Flask, and requests to fetch and display weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). Users can enter a city name and view the current weather conditions for that city.

Your task is to containerize this application, including all of its dependencies.

**Copy this whole folder exercise to your local computer.**

The folder `weather-app` contains several files and directories. All these files need to be **in the same directory** in the container, for the application to work properly.

The application **uses `Python`** with the `Flask`, `Werkzeug` and `requests` packages, Which are specified with the used version, in the `requirements.txt` file.

The application will run on Flasks default port, 5000.
