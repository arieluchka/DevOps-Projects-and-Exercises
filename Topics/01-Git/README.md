# Git
[Git 100 seconds intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE)


Git is a **change-tracking technology**.

When we write code/files, We always change them. When we add a new feature, create a new file, fix a bug, delete a folder, we are always changing our project.

The problem is, once we hit that `ctrl + s` to save our work and close the file, we will never be able to go back to the previous state.

Let's say we are working on a python project. We are writing lots of classes, functions and use lots of libraries. We can spend hours, days, even weeks, to work on a new addition to our project.

But what if after a week, we find a **major security flaw** in our code??? To fix it, we would need to spend **days** searching through 1000's of lines of code and search for the bugs and security flaws.

With git, we would simply be able to "go back in time" of an earlier version of our code, before we wrote the compromising code, saving us critical time.

Git is an amazing tool for **much more than tracking** our projects! I hope this repo will help you see the power of using git, and will teach you and help you exercise the best way to implement it into your daily workflow!


## Important notes!!!
### Git IS NOT GitHub/GitLab
Git is a technology. By default it is implemented locally. 

We can track all our progress locally, save "time stamps" of our code locally, and go back in time locally. But we **can** also upload our repo to the **cloud**. 

GitHub, GitLab and other remote git repositories, allow us to 

- share our work with others
- Have multiple people work on the same project in the same time
- backup our project to the cloud (if our laptop breaks, we still have a copy of our project and all its history in the cloud!)

**But we dont need GitHub/GitLab to use git!**

### The place you are in right now, is a Git repo!
This file, this whole folder, is a git repo that i pushed to GitHub, from my local computer.

Every time i add a new lab or exercise, i will commit the changes, add a message, maybe even create a branch, and you can see it all!

You can see all the commits i've made, what i added and what i've deleted. The entire history of this project! Feel free to:
- [open issues](https://github.com/arieluchka/DevOps-Projects-and-Exercises/issues), if you think there is a bug in the labs/you have a suggestion to improve something.
- [look through the history of this repo](https://github.com/arieluchka/DevOps-Projects-and-Exercises/commit/) and see what changed between commits (try to find the commit of this readme file!).
- [create a pull request](https://github.com/arieluchka/DevOps-Projects-and-Exercises/pulls) if you want to add your code to the repository.

### To learn
[Git Tutorial For Dummies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY) a great video explaining some git concepts in a very simple and friendly way.

### To practice
[learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a great site to practice levels of git commands and see their effect in a visual way.

[visualizing-git](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) is a tool to visualize git commands. There are not explicit exercises, but you can use this tool while working with git, to understand better what your commands are doing.
