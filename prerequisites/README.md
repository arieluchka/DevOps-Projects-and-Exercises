Hi all!

Some of the projects, exercises and labs will require prior setup for everything to work smoothly!

## Enable showing hidden files and folders
Sometimes, some folders and files are hidden by default!
This is usually the case with system files.

But for you to see and understand the entire process and the "behind the scenes", it's better if we'll be able to see those hidden items.

In Linux, Hidden files and folders will usually begin with a dot "." and will be hidden by default when using the `ls` command.

BUT! Using the `ls` command with the flag `-a` will let you see all folders and files (even the hidden ones).

## Enable showing Extensions for files
This one is very important for windows users!

Windows will usually create new files with the `.txt` extension, but will hide it by default!

so if you want to add an extension, and you didn't activate the "see file extensions" feature, you could think that you added a `.py` to a file, but actually its saved as `.py.txt`
